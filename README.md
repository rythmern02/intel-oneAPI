## A Brief of the Prototype:
  The CWSN web app prototype is designed to be a user-friendly platform for children with special needs. It includes various features such as interactive learning modules, personalized study plans, and a virtual classroom environment that simulates a real-world classroom experience.

The prototype uses Django as the web development framework and integrates several Intel® AI Analytics Toolkits and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras for image and speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine learning. Additionally, the prototype also uses the SYCL/DPC++ Libraries for parallel computing and optimization.

Here are the UML diagrams for the prototype:
