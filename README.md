## A Brief of the Prototype:
Our CWSN educational web app prototype is designed to provide a fun and interactive learning experience for children with special needs. The app features a variety of games, quizzes, and videos that cater to different learning styles, and allows parents and teachers to monitor progress through a dashboard. The prototype uses Django web framework, HTML/CSS for front-end, and MySQL for database management. The app also incorporates Intel AI Analytics Toolkits and libraries such as OpenCV, Tensorflow, and DPC++ for enhancing the learning experience. Overall, our prototype aims to make education accessible and enjoyable for CWSN children.

Here are the UML diagrams for the prototype:

## Tech Stack: 
   The prototype uses Django as the web development framework and integrates several IntelÂ® AI Analytics Toolkits and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras for image and speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine learning. Additionally, the prototype also uses the SYCL/DPC++ Libraries for parallel computing and optimization
   
## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  this is a django application so we need to follow django web app instructions.
